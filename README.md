Hey everyone,

Thanks for checking out this Unity Extension repository. I've included some samples of my work.

1) BranchSpawner (and its associated custom editor) is a utility for generating customized trees. A tree mesh is combined with a branch mesh, and branches are randomized according to input properties. The result may then be finalized - a process that combines all meshes and materials into a single prefab with decimation and LODs.
2) TomTools is a collection of helper functions for general tasks.
3) MeshExtended is a collection of helper functions for meshes - including flattening meshes and materials.

I welcome any feedback!

Thanks,
Tom
